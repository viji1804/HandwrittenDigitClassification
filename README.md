# HandwrittenDigitClassification
This project demonstrates the application of an SVM for image classification tasks, specifically for handwritten digit recognition. The MNIST dataset provides a standard benchmark for evaluating classification algorithms. By following the steps of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, we can effectively build and assess an SVM model for digit classification. This project showcases the importance of data preprocessing and the power of SVMs in handling high-dimensional data for classification tasks.
